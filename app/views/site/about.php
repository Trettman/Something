                This site is created by Otto Sellerstam, a 17 year old student with an interest in development. I've created it mainly for educational purposes, but
                if it makes life easier for others I'll consider the project a success.

                <strong>The site</strong>
                <br>
                The site is mainly meant to act as a tool for party hosts that don't feel like they want any traditional presents, but instead want people to bring
                their own drinks to your party.
